#发布过程

1.通过命令行执行 npm build (详细命令见下面说明)

2.将/build目录和其同级的index.html文件复制到web目录下

此过程当前是通过手动执行的,后续通过配置应该能通过mvn自动完成.


#完成标准

1.功能完备:
  
   A.分配和流程的所有功能点
   
   B.分配和流程的切换
   
   C.模块的处理
   
   D.登陆和权限控制
   
2.样式: 基于bootstrap的自定义样式(应仅包含bs里使用到的样式,主要部分应是个性化的,不是大路货)

3.propType: 各组件的每个prop都应有对应的type,以便进行类型检查

4.ut: 主要部分应该有单元测试


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
