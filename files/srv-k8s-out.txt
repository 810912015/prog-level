Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(bid -u):$(bid -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 10.10.171.53:6443 --token 4xt1am.8y7ipgwlwuny1qtf \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:b131e24d01a976aa4139b022bf4a9f8ece8f433dcf383d3ebc3fb7c40652277e
